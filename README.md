This is just a little app I created in follow up to a recent technical interview. The purpose of building this app was to practice:
* Making Ajax requests using jQuery
* Working with data received from an API
* Adding elements to the DOM
* And writing some custom CSS

I'm accessing The Star Wars API (or "swapi")
